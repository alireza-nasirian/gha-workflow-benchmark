CI builds might take longer now.\r\n\r\n* Update build.yml\r\n\r\nDowngrade to g++12 and revert change to using normal runners\r\n\r\n* Update build.yml\r\n\r\nGo back to ubuntu-24.04 and update both gcc and clang to their latest versions according to [this](https://github.com/actions/runner-images/blob/main/images/ubuntu/Ubuntu2404-Readme.md?plain=1#L16-L20).\r\n\r\n* Update build.yml\r\n\r\nGo back to g++13 for now, as we get some exotic warning in g++14 for newer C++ standards.\r\n\r\n* Update build.yml\r\n\r\nFix the other issues with `macos-latest` going to arm: https://github.com/actions/runner-images/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#available-images and that Swift wasn't installed in the ubuntu-24.04 by default.\r\n\r\n* Update build.yml\r\n\r\nDisable Kotlin MacOs CI",
